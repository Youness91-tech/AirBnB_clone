# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
The console is the foundational component of Holberton School's AirBnB project, offering a comprehensive introduction to essential advanced programming concepts. The primary goal of the AirBnB project is to ultimately launch a server hosting a refined emulation of the AirBnB website, known as HBnB. This module focuses on creating an interactive command interpreter, allowing efficient management and control of objects integral to the AirBnB (HBnB) website's operations.

# What's a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It's exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

### Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/Youness91-tech/AirBnB_clone.git"`
* Access AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
* Run hbnb(interactively): `./console` and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`

### Example how to open:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
